SQL Files
===========

Each of these files contains one or multiple SQL statements. They must not
contain any Transaction statements (BEGIN TRANSACTION, ROLLBACK, COMMIT)!
Except for the special transaction-files (trans_begin.sql, trans_rollback.sql,
trans_commit.sql).

The preprocessor detects comment lines - lines starting with "--" or "#" and
optionally some spaces. Lines that contain valid SQL code and continue with a
SQL comment (--) will not be detected, you must know whether your SQL-processor
knows how to handle it if you move to anything else than PgSQL, but the code
will break then anyway.

---Does PgSQL support "--" in remote commands?---

Parameters have the format "$" plus one other character, which will be used to
identify it (this differs much from JDBC!). This is done for the case the
parameters are moved while optimizing certain statements.

Example of a SQL-file:
###################
#example.sql
#written by Konrad Rosenbaum
#optimized for being stupid, by KR
#
#This file will generate ../sql_example.h and #define SQL_EXAMPLE
#
#Param $a: some arbitrary trash
#      $b: some other trash

SELECT * FROM trashtable WHERE trashkey = $a OR something LIKE $b;
###################
