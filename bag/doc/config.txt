Configuring BagD
====================

The Bagd config is stored in the table options. The only thing the server gets
when it starts is the connection string to the database containing the options
and the repository.

You call the server:
bagd "connstring" [-d]
where -d means "debug" (ie. the server does not go to background);
connstring contains options for PostgreSQL (see PSQL docu for details), the
most important are:
hostaddr=<host to connect to (localhost)>
port=<port of the db (5432)>
dbname=<name of the repository DB>
user=<user to use for connection>
password=<if required: password of that user>

Options are hierarchical, colon (":") separated. A typical option key could
look like: "srv:socket:1", where "socket" is the facility to configure and "1"
the iteration (for options which may be repeated multiple times). "srv" denotes
one of possibly several servers on the same database (default is "").


Current options
----------------

socket:<iter>
  one for each listening socket of this server. Valid formats for the value
  are:

  tcp:<port>
  tcp6:<port>
    TCP/TCPv6 socket, please note that TCPv6 sockets listen to TCPv4
    connections also (if you want both you only need to initialize TCPv6)
  
  ssl:<port>
  ssl6:<port>
    SSL over TCP/TCPv6 socket

  unix:</path>
  local:</path>
    AF_UNIX socket on /path

  sunix:</path>
  slocal:</path>
    SSL over AF_UNIX socket (could anybody possibly be that paranoide?)
