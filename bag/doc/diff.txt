Text Diff
==========

This applies to text files only. The algorithm and format work on complete
lines and are sensitive on tabs and spaces.

The parser algorithm treats \n, \r, \r\n and \n\r as a single newline. The
combinations \r\r and \n\n are treated as two newlines.

In contrast to GNU Diff it does not expect a trailing newline at the end of the
file. Thus a trailing newline will create an empty  last line.

Diff Format
------------

The first character of each line is a command about what to do with this line.
The remainder of the line depends on the first character:

@objectid
 open a new object (if a combined patch: close the last one)

$
 flatten the object (ie. renumber the lines) and continue with the next patch
 on this same object, identical to @objectid if objectid is identical to the
 last one

+line
 inserted line with complete text

-line
 deleted line with complete text

=line
 identical line with complete text

*num
 number of inserted lines (not very useful, only here for completenes)

~num
 number of deleted lines

#num
 number of identical lines



Diff Algorithm
---------------

The algorithm is linear with a quite short recursion.

It basically searches the two files by comparing the lines. If they are not
identical there are two possibilities: a line has been deleted or inserted.
To differentiate the algorithm only needs to search for this original line in
the new file: if it finds it, something was inserted, if not it was deleted.
To limit the impact of identical lines (eg. the closing "}" of functions) the
search is limited to a certain amount of lines (MAXSEARCH in the source) and
a certain division of the complete amount of lines (DIVSEARCH).

Yet, I guess this algorithm can still use some optimization...
...anybody understood the specific optimizations of GNU Diff?

Patch Algorithm
----------------

Simple. The algorithm follows linear the commandments of the patch.

Merge Algorithm
----------------

More tricky. Here is a changed file and a patch to its ancestor.

[Need to think about something - diff3 like?]
